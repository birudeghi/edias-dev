# Flashlight
An ongoing side project to create CodePen for Arduino. Web devs can upload embed their .ino file into a web widget, enabling visitors to plug in their Arduino board and flash it with the .hex file.
Visitors can also interact with their board in the same widget.
Currently it is only able to connect through Web Serial API, and send and receive bitarrays. Compiling and flashing coming soon.
To start:
<code>cd client</code>
<code>yarn start</code>
